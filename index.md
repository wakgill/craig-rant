<textarea>If you want a warâ€¦&#013; &#010; 

I will do 2 years of no trade. Nothing.&#013; &#010; 

In the war, no coin can trade.&#013; &#010; 

If you want ABC, you want shitcoins, welcome to bankruptcy.&#013; &#010; 

It was nice knowing you.&#013; &#010; 

Bitcoin will die before ABC shits on it. I will see BCH trade at 0 for a few years. Will you?&#013; &#010; 

Side with ABC, you hate bitcoin, you are my enemy. You have no fucking idea what that means.&#013; &#010; 

You will.&#013; &#010; 

I AM Satoshi. Have a nice life. You will now discover me when pissed off.&#013; &#010; 

And so. You could have had proof. Your choice.&#013; &#010; 

Fuck you,&#013; &#010;
